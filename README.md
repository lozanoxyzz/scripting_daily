SCRIPTING DAILY
As it name implies, it's going to be a daily practice of scripting.

I'll be working with Python, Bash and Powershell to improve my scripting abilities across different environments.

I don't know if i'll be working with another languages but this ones are very intersting to me.

We are going to be focusing on scripting and network automation, as we go forward topics could be more than the previous mentioned.
